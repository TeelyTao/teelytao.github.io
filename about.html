<h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
<p class="info">I have a youtube channel which I created in 2021. I also have a X account but its inactive. I like creating things. I play bloons tower defense 6 a lot too (my username is shabaz6105). If you want to add me on discord then add doesknow. with the period. This is the first website I ever made that was hosted and properly built since my previous attemps failed. This is my only website that is being hosted right now as all the other ones stopped being hosted due to lack of motivation or managing disputes.</p>
